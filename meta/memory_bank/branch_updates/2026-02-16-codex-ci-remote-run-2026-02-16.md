# Branch updates — codex/ci-remote-run-2026-02-16

- [x] **[BUG][CI]** Skip unsupported dependency-review on fork repositories
  - Spec: `meta/memory_bank/specs/work_items/2026-02-16__bugfix__security-gates-skip-dependency-review-on-fork.md`
  - Owner: Codex
  - Branch: `codex/ci-remote-run-2026-02-16`
  - Done: 2026-02-16
  - Summary: Added fork guard in Security Gates so `dependency-review` is skipped on fork repos where the action is unsupported.
  - Tests: `N/A (workflow-only fix; verification through GitHub Actions checks)`
  - Risks: Low (no behavior change for non-fork repositories)

- [x] **[BUG][CI]** Stabilize PR gates: lint, migration-check, and base-policy rechecks
  - Spec: `meta/memory_bank/specs/work_items/2026-02-16__bugfix__ci-pr-gates-stabilize-lint-migration-and-base-policy.md`
  - Owner: Codex
  - Branch: `codex/ci-remote-run-2026-02-16`
  - Done: 2026-02-16
  - Summary: Added base-branch edit trigger for branch policy, fixed Alembic config path in migration-check, and switched lint gates to incremental changed-file checks.
  - Tests: `N/A (workflow-only fix; verification through GitHub Actions checks/logs)`
  - Risks: Low-Medium (PR lint is incremental by design to avoid legacy debt noise)
