description: Select workflow + list required steps
agent: plan

Identify the task type (new feature / bug fix / refactor / code review / other).

Then open the matching workflow doc under `.memory_bank/workflows/` and:

1. State the chosen workflow name.
2. List the exact steps you will follow for this task.
3. Call out any mandatory step you cannot complete and ask exactly one targeted question.

Do not start implementation until the workflow gate is satisfied.
