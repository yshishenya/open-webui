# AGENTS.md (managed)

These instructions are generated by `sdd-workflow-kit` and are intended for AI agents and humans.

## At the Start of ANY Work Session (MANDATORY)

1. Read `meta/memory_bank/README.md` completely.
2. Follow its mandatory reading sequence:
   - `meta/memory_bank/tech_stack.md`
   - `meta/memory_bank/guides/coding_standards.md`
   - `meta/memory_bank/current_tasks.md`
3. Pick the right workflow doc for the task type:
   - New feature: `meta/memory_bank/workflows/new_feature.md`
   - Bug fix: `meta/memory_bank/workflows/bug_fix.md`
   - Code review: `meta/memory_bank/workflows/code_review.md`
   - Refactor: `meta/memory_bank/workflows/refactoring.md`

If the Memory Bank is missing or incomplete, bootstrap it first via this kit and treat that work as a work item.

## Project

- Name: `open-webui`
- Integration branch: `airis_b2c`
- Upstream base (if any): `Open WebUI`

## Fork / Upstream Sync Discipline (if this repo is a fork)

Goal: keep the diff small to minimize conflicts with upstream updates.

- Prefer additive changes (new files/modules) over editing upstream-owned files.
- If an upstream-owned file must be edited: keep diffs minimal and avoid formatting churn.
- Document upstream impact in the work item spec when non-trivial.
- See: `meta/memory_bank/guides/upstream_sync.md`

## Self-Documentation (No-Conflict Task Updates)

Do not edit the shared task list on feature branches.

- Rules: `meta/memory_bank/guides/task_updates.md`
- Work item specs (one per change): `meta/memory_bank/specs/work_items/`
- Branch updates (append-only): `meta/memory_bank/branch_updates/`

## SDD (Spec-Driven Development)

- SDD root: `meta/sdd`
- Specs: `meta/sdd/specs/{pending,active,completed}/`
- Schema cache: `meta/sdd/schema/`
- Always use wrapper: `meta/tools/sdd ...`

## Type Safety

- All new/modified functions must have type hints.
- Avoid `Any` in type hints; use concrete types.

## Async I/O

- Do not block the event loop (no sync HTTP in async functions).
- Prefer async http clients (e.g. `httpx.AsyncClient`) and async DB patterns used in the repo.

## Error Handling & Logging

- Follow `meta/memory_bank/patterns/error_handling.md`.
- Prefer standard `logging` (routed into Loguru if configured by the repo).
- Never log secrets.

## Testing (Docker-first when Compose exists)

If the repository is Docker Compose-first, prefer running tests via compose wrappers documented in:

- `meta/memory_bank/guides/testing_strategy.md`
- `meta/memory_bank/guides/assistant_tooling.md`

## Kit usage
