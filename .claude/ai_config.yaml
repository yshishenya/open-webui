# Local SDD toolkit AI configuration (project-scoped).

# Goal: make `sdd review` (sdd-plan-review) synthesis use a tool/model that is
# available in this environment. Without this, the synthesis step may pick a
# provider-specific model (e.g. Gemini) and then fail during fallback, even if
# Codex reviews succeeded.
#
# Feel free to adjust agent order to your preference.
