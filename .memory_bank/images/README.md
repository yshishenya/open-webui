# Memory Bank Images & Artifacts

This folder contains spreadsheets and other artifacts referenced from `.memory_bank/` specs and task logs.

## Naming rules (recommended)

- Prefer `kebab-case` (or `snake_case`) and avoid spaces/parentheses.
- If you rename an artifact, update every reference in `.memory_bank/**`.

## Current files

- `price_analysis_competitor_vs_official.xlsx`: Competitor vs official pricing comparison used for rate card decisions.
- `rate_card_recommended_import.xlsx`: Import-ready example/template for rate cards.
- `rate-cards-all_units_template (2).xlsx` / `rate-cards-all_units_template (2)-filled.xlsx`: Legacy template + filled sample (referenced from task history).
- `image.png`: Miscellaneous image (should be renamed if it becomes referenced).
